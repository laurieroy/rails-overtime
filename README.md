This app was built in Feb 2021 as a code along by [Jordan Hudgens](https://www.udemy.com/course/professional-ruby-on-rails-coding-course/learn/lecture/5529548#overview). Although I've done systems testing before, I'm not sure of how much unit testing to include, and hoped this course would help answer that. The code along is Rails 5, but I'm using Rails 6. Hopefully not too many breaking changes.
